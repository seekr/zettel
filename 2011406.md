title: Creating and Editing zettels

You may use any text editor with Markdown support to edit your zettel files. Neuron provides a command to create new zettel files with the suitable <2011403?cf>:

```bash
neuron new "My zettel title"
```

This command will print the path to the file created. Use `-e` to also open the text editor:


```bash
neuron new "My zettel title" -e
```

Newly created zettels will be a cluster of its own (see <2012301>) until you connect other zettels to them.

## Opening a Zettel by title

See <2013501?cf>.


## Editor integration

Emacs support is available via [neuron-mode](https://github.com/felko/neuron-mode), which supports nifty editor features like opening a zettel by title, linking to other zettels by title, as well as displaying the title of the zettel next to the link (see screenshot below).
