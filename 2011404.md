title: Zettel Markdown
---

Zettel files are written using Markdown, per the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specification. Neuron uses [commonmark-hs](https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs) to parse them into the [Pandoc AST](https://pandoc.org/using-the-pandoc-api.html), as well as provides an extention on top to handle zettel links.
