Neuron allows you to organically build a hierarchy out of your Zettelkasten over time. This is achieved by <2011504?cf> *without* the `cf` flag. When a zettel links to another, it "branches of" to that zettel ... unless `cf` is used (in which case it is not a branch off). 

**Uplink trees** are a kind of category tree that display all zettels that branch off to a particular zettel. The uplink tree of a zettel is displayed at the top of each zettel page.
