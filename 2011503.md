A zettelkasten is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), and <2017401> is a subset of this graph established by having zettels branch off to other zettels.

## z-index 

The z-index page (at `/z-index.html`; also linked in the footer) displays your Zettelkasten graph. Neuron detects if there are any cycles in your Zettelkasten graph (use `cf` to resolve cycles). Then, it detects all <2012301> in the graph, and displays the <2017401> for each cluster.

## Uplinks and Backlinks

Uplinks are a kind of backlinks. Specifically an uplink tree of a zettel is the subset of the category tree which branch off to the zettel. Uplink tree is displayed above the zettel; other backlinks are displayed below.
