Tags can be nested using a "tag/subtag" syntax, to allow a more fine-grained organization of your Zettelkasten, especially when using advanced queries as shown in <2011506?cf>.

For example, the following zettel is tagged "math/calculus/definition"

```markdown
---
title: Derivative
tags:
  - math/calculus/definition
---
```

It will be included in the following tag queries:

- `math/**`
- `math/calculus/*`
- `math/calculus/definition`
- `**/definition`

See <2011506?cf> to understand how to link zettels automatically based on tag patterns as above.

## Tag trees

Use `<z:tags?filter=**`> to render your entire tags set as a tree. Note that this only *renders* the tags; whereas `<z:zettels?tag=...>` of <2011506?cf> exists to *link* to the zettels tagged with matching tags.
